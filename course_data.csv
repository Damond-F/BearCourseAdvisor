avidfanatic12,Unfortunately my parents and their friends don't care and are still having indoor parties of 30+ for Indian festivals.
nemicolopterus,"I'm always confused by these posts because we never stopped locking down. Did people start living normally?? (I wouldn't know because I literally don't leave my house aside from groceries once every two weeks).

&#x200B;

Thanks for the details, though - fully agree.

Revolutionary_List31,"And for students who do decide to go home for Christmas, test first, hunker down at home and test again after a week. And don't be visiting all of your high school friends while there!"
ExtraCaramel8,Thank you for posting this! I’m lucky to be with my parents right now but for my fellow bears if you’re gonna be all alone for the holiday season please make sure to take care of your mental health. It’s so tough but as Prof said there’s light in the end. Feel free to DM me if you ever just want someone to talk!!
mydogthinksiamcool,My aunt just passed away from covid. She caught it from her son. They live together. She refused to go to the hotel and decided she would just be fine. She did not make it. If you catch covid... force your parents to go away... or you go to a motel. Don’t be in the same house as anyone older than 40.
None,"Thank you for your post Nick.

It really means a lot getting guidance from one of the course faculty.

 Berkeley is very lucky to have you."

None,Thank you for posting this. It's really motivating to hear a glimmer of hope with such a dim horizon looming this winter.
Crisc0Disc0,My 75 year old father who has high blood pressure and previous heart attacks continues to go out to eat at restaurants in Texas and thinks doctors are lying about positive tests to get money from the government.  I'm very worried and nothing I say will convince him otherwise.

rsha256,"I’m even more hyped for 61C with Weaver next semester now, thank you for caring about the Berkeley student community❤️"
Leahrsi,"Thanks so much for the post. I had covid back in March and haven’t fully recovered. Currently, my sister, 3 uncles and 2 aunts have covid. One is gravely ill in the hospital. They’re in the Midwest where masks and social distancing have not been mandated. 

Please keep everyone safe by social distancing, mask wearing and not attending parties. There were far too many Halloween parties at Cal given the pandemic. 

We can help (re)flatten the curve by being responsible and saying no to unsafe activities."
ranchgod,I wish you could virtually knock some sense into my friends. They fucking need it. Thanks for these posts.
mysticaleyeballs,Would you advise against students going back to Berkeley for spring? (For the ones they have stayed home during fall)
arunankogulan,Thanks for the advice Nick! Do you think the worry about COVID vaccines being expedited through the FDA approval process is a legitimate cause for concern? I would hate for Fall 2021 to be online because too many people are scared of a vaccine

I think you would enjoy reading Dr. Zeynep Tufekci's pieces on the pandemic if you haven't already been following her.

373nhoang01,"Wow this is a well detailed post and i can tell you put some thought and effort. Thank you. I'm sure this isn't going to happen but as a professor I think you might like this tidbit. As a physician, a significant portion of my training is on effective communication. To a group of grad students, especially UC Berkeley, its a clear and digestible message. If I think of Dr. Fauci saying this to the public, I can also see few people losing hope, few getting worried, and a few preparing for a post-apocalyptic Earth. I'm fairly certain this isn't going to happen but more of a potentiality for future references! Hopefully you find this tidbit useful being a professor!"
xster,"The one part I want to pick at and wish there were more studies or statistics on: I don't know if risks to young people is so binary. As in you die or you win. There's enough reports or long haulers, neurological issues, cardiovascular issues that I don't know if not dying is the only success."

RandomHuman77,"I was planning on going home to Central America for Christmas (which involves getting on two flights), but I'm starting to reconsider. Seeing the COVID case chart on NYT every morning is terrifying.

I keep hoping my country will close its borders like they did from March to August so that I can stay in the Bay Area for Christmas without being disowned."
None,">It is also important to understand the risk.  For most University students the risk you face if you are infected with COVID is in roughly the same ballpark as joining a fraternity. 

What on *earth* is this supposed to mean? 

No one tries to avoid being in a fraternity and is surprised to be in one. And individual chances for being accepted into a fraternity are incredibly individual. Do you even have a percentage of tries-to-pledge versus accepted-into-a-frat percentages you’re attempting to reference?"
pargofan,TIL joining a fraternity is just like contracting COVID.

BlankVerse,"> When you do go out, try to wear one of the disposable blue procedure masks rather than just a cloth mask: procedure masks do offer some level of incoming protection.

Or wear a cloth mask (preferably 2-3 layers of thick cotton) over a disposable mask because the blue masks often don't provide a good seal. If your glasses fog, the mask isn't doing its job. 

Otherwise it all looks like good advice."

It'll be interesting to see whether/how the vaccine news changes this mentality."
ultralame,"Yes. Entire swaths of the country were packed into bars and restaurants on Halloween like it was normal again.

Orange county is full of assholes without masks ignoring any restrictions.

My friends and extended family have been going to bars, hanging out, having guests over from out of state, going to big family gatherings, and basically carrying on as though nothing is wrong. It's too much for them. They've gone full ostrich. I have groceries delivered by instacart. I go to the drive-thru pharmacy, and that's it. I haven't had anyone come into my home since February who doesn't live here. And what pisses me off the most is that if everyone was behaving like us, this thing would already be over with."

NicholasWeaver,"I'd just worry about traveling truth be told.  The airports are going to be absolute hot-boxes for COVID, even if the HVAC system on planes are good.  Testing & self-isolating would mitigate if you were driving but even then, is it worth the risk?"
tireddoggie,"the incubation period of covid is approx. 14 days. so lets say you get infected the day before you travel and get tested the day you are traveling, the test can still come back negative only for you to start showing symptoms the day after when it is too late and you have exposed multiple people including your family. that is part of why this is so tricky because you can be asymptomatic, even test negative in the first couple days, but still be contagious. unless you plan on quarantining for fourteen days and wearing a mask when you are home, testing, unfortunately, doesn't mitigate your risk and is a false security blanket."
bentref11,"No, you are a monster if you think it's OK to go home for thanksgiving.

You can sequester all you want, but you can't stop me (or some other superspreader) from aggressively breathing in your general direction."
NicholasWeaver,"Berkeley is conservative on COVID, so Spring is going to be as sucky as Fall is.  Which is the right decision IMO."
NicholasWeaver,"NO!  The pharmaceutical companies and FDA saw the risk and said “hell no”.  Why do you think Trump is so pissed that the announcements were after the election?  If anything the result may be better.  Trump claims credit now (and really, he should, Pfizer may not have taken money for R&D but is taking advantage of a $2B guaranteed sale) so his followers get it.  But the process was not corrupted so everyone else can get it.

Additionally, that mRNA vaccines work so well against this is astonishingly good news.  Those vaccines may be a pain to ship and distribute, but we do know how to distribute stuff like that.  But by being non-replicative, an mRNA vaccine is going to naturally be very safe.  And this creates a good development flow as well, so come COVID-27 we would have “virus isolated in November, vaccine in January”"

Pornfest,"It’s about protecting others you fucking knuckle dragger.

You don’t have some “right” to be normal, you have an obligation to your fellow humans to not play into the tragedy of the commons. 

Look, you need mental health services. Both for the depression and the anti-social behaviors you are justifying. I can empathize with the suicidal thoughts—you’re not alone there whatsoever. I am here for you if you need someone to talk to.

But, “I deserve a great Thanksgiving and Christmas” ? Get fucked. It’s not about you, it’s about you spreading it to others you will never know or meet. Case in point: all your sentences about the virus are about you being alright with *getting* the virus, not *giving* it to others."
registeredvoter7,"/r/thathappened

cool story bro.

""I have never seen a single COVID patient display any symptom that the media says you’d have with COVID."" - haha what? you're saying that they have no coughing, no fever, no loss of smell/taste, no fatigue, no shortness of breath, no brain fog? why are they even in the hospital then?

p.s. curious what you think about [https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/jti80f/these\_last\_few\_weeks\_feel\_like\_purgatory/](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/jti80f/these_last_few_weeks_feel_like_purgatory/)"

“I have never seen a single COVID patient display any symptom that the media says you’d have with COVID.”

Well, someone’s not doing their job since 1) you’re either neglectful/ignorant since you’re presumably supposed to be supervising the patients and/or 2) apparently the media is the only source of information you choose to utilize as a certified health worker."
Burnburnburnnow,"Hey- no one answered so I’ll give it a try.

Do you know what hotboxing is? If not, search for some clips on YouTube, it’s definitely been shown in movies like Grandma’s Boy and Pineapple Express. Though a hotbox is probably on the extreme end of contact high, that should give you an idea. In an average room, you would prob get a contact high if there is visible smoke hanging in the air, but it’s all about timing which makes it an excellent example.

For instance, you can sit in a hotboxed car for three min and you’re not getting a contact high. Or, you can sit in a room for an hour or two while your friends casually pass a bong back and forth and find yourself feeling funny when you go to leave. 

It’s concentration *and* duration of exposure that count. For the weed example, things like tolerance, weight (in general), and body fat are all going to effect how your body metabolizes the THC. I’m sure you could make similar comparisons with COVID and different folks medical history and general health.

Hope this was helpful, stay safe."

CatFanFanOfCats,"Info:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrington_Event?


The Carrington Event was a powerful geomagnetic storm on September 1–2, 1859, during solar cycle 10 (1855–1867). A solar coronal mass ejection (CME) hit Earth's magnetosphere and induced the largest geomagnetic storm on record. The associated ""white light flare"" in the solar photosphere was observed and recorded by British astronomers Richard Carrington and Richard Hodgson. The storm caused strong auroral displays and wrought havoc with telegraph systems. The now-standard unique IAU identifier for this flare is SOL1859-09-01."
SendMeYourQuestions,"Risks can be mitigated through quarantine/self-isolation. You are spreading an enormous amount of false insecurity.

Yes, absolutely COVID is very dangerous and yes, absolutely our hospitals are filling (nationally), but also yes, people can take precautions that mitigate their risk significantly and yes, families which have scientific/medical literacy can change their behaviors to the point that some social visits can be safe.

To boot, there are also real risks involved in *not* socialising. Every individual and family needs to consider their behaviors, risk tolerance and the various opportunity costs and make the decision that is right for them and their community.

The only one size fits all advice are the facts about how the coronavirus is transferred and what behaviors prevent that spread."
phitaupi,This would only be true if I only tested once before traveling. Being on campus means me (and everyone I am with) are tested twice a week. I don’t interact with people not getting constantly tested (by the nature of living in the dorms) so the chance of magically getting it on the BART going on while wearing a mask is pretty slim.

RandomHuman77,"Yeah, I'm leaning towards staying in the bay for Christmas. Especially since I'm likely to get the vaccine in the spring and go home without a problem then."
jmp-f88,"First, I love your insult of fucking knuckle dragger.

Second, I also agree it’s not about them, like what’s up with the sentiment of “”I respect everyone’s right to shelter themselves,” but I’m not going to.”” (slightly paraphrased) Because even people who shelter at home still need to go places sometimes like idk the store to buy food or to go to the doctor? So since this person is being selfish and potentially spreading their maybe covid to these places, they are actively impeding the rights and health of the people who are choosing to be staying at home, so...no they don’t respect them because that’s practically the complete opposite of respect. And they could still be potentially infected and then they stayed home for nothing because they still got sick because of people who act as selfish as this, as you said, fucking knuckle dragger.

And then as a final thought/complaint, obviously it’s no good this person has contemplated suicide over their ~inhumane isolation, but as a person with a lot of mental health problems where ordinary life makes me want to kill myself half the time, I have ZERO tolerance/sympathy for that being someone’s excuse to stop caring about their fellow Americans health during a goddamn PANDEMIC. Like, suicide is a drastic measure for missing thanksgiving. Call a doctor, call a friend, call a hotline, call a therapist, make an appointment for therapy or to get some meds, because those are better steps at fixing your depression problem rather than gathering with people potentially spreading the plague, because pretty sure the guilt from accidentally killing someone from your disease spreading wouldn’t be a pro in the “don’t commit suicide” column. 

(I’m fine now and never have active plans to kill myself don’t worry, I see my doctor regularly and take lots of meds and do lots of therapy. It’s still a hard battle that covid19 isolation doesn’t help, but I’m also not some asshole who would rather have people literally DIE than be inconvenienced. I can’t comprehend how and why people are being so fucking selfish about this.) /end rant, thanks for coming to my tedtalk."
None,">But, “I deserve a great Thanksgiving and Christmas” ? Get fucked. It’s not about you, it’s about you spreading it to others you will never know or meet.

The hypocrisy is ripe. I now don't have the right to be with people I love because you want to dictate what I can/can't do, yet you have the right to force others into solitary confinement which is causing a skyrocketed increase in suicides, self-harm, depression, and domestic abuse among many other terrible things?

I only spend time with people who also accept the risks. Being able to assess the risks for myself and act accordingly to what I think is best for myself is my right as a human being and there's nothing wrong with that. Likewise, you have the right to assess your situation and act with appropriate measures in the way you see fit.

I'll just leave it at this. We both have rights and no matter how much some of us may want to restrict others, it's simply not going to happen and people are going to exercise their rights no matter what, as they should."

bentref11,"Absolutely.

Of course, I also know lots of people who *always* thought that way, from the beginning of the pandemic. It's not even a matter of fatigue for them, it's just ""look mate, this has a 0.0000000000001% fatality rate, best just accept the risk and move on lmao"""
ultralame,"We've literally had the best numbers for any major urban area throughout the pandemic.

SF specifically has the lowest rate of infection and death for any large city in the usa.  And done so with the highest density this side of Newark, New Jersey.  And it's because of extremely strict city rules on opening back up along with the highest estimated mask usage. On top of that are the percentage of people who can work remotely and the population's personal decisions not to congregate or violate those rules.

So please don't compare that statement to the subjective ""SF is the best place on earth"" bullshit.

I have friends in TN and FL afraid to leave their houses, because they are confronted for wearing masks at the grocery store. One friend is a teacher and was called ""a cunt"" at a school meeting because she didn't want to expose herself and family to covid in their rural IL town. 

So yes... I am proud of our city and the bay area on covid, and I don't think there's any reason not to be."
deleted_my_account,"dawww :,)"
gniknus,"Really appreciate your post! I’m a huge fan of tools like your M&Ms metaphor to help people digest the data and make the risk stats real to them as an individual and family.

If you have any insight to share into how to think about assessing earthquake risk in the bay area in this way would love to hear your perspective.

I’ve done some surface level scratching into how to think about earthquake risk as an family in the bay area and was pretty concerned with what I saw. My husband is a grad student at Cal and we’re considering moving from our seismically retrofitted apartment in Berkeley into SF. But as we started looking deeper into how most places in SF are expected to hold up when the next big earthquake hits we realized how risky it is to live in most of the places we were looking at (row houses in the middle part of the city, which are practically all unretrofitted since they are under 5 stories and therefore don’t fall under the soft story mandate). I’m an analyst so I couldn’t help but run an extremely back of hand risk assessment based on a stitching together of data from the Haywired scenario and the research that went into the soft story mandate, and I ended up with a 4-8% chance a family of four living in an unretrofitted soft story row house in SF experiencing at least one death in the family due to building collapses (!). My calculation was pretty rough but if the real risk is even close to that it seemed wild to us that the danger of SF’s iconic row houses isn’t a topic with more attention on it."
oogalog,"I generally trust your risk assessment, so maybe you can answer this: why do some people think it’s important to have more than a week’s supply of food and water for an earthquake? Anytime there’s an earthquake, aren’t there cities like 10 miles away that are untouched and that have supplies? To me it seems like that degree of preparation would only be needed if you were trapped at your house by a bad injury, lack of car/gas/safe roads, _and_ lack of telephone lines/cell phone battery/reception. Or am I too naïvely believing in quick and accessible rescue operations?"
OaklandWarrior,"(Lurker here redirected from another subreddit) yeah, growing up in Oakland this was always the great fear..the Hayward fault finally shaking loose. Thanks for your post OP."
Leahrsi,"I think what’s important to know is the test is a snapshot. In this example, if you were exposed the day before getting a test, it would likely be negative because covid has a 14 day incubation period. Even though you’re positive the test wouldn’t show it until 4 days after exposure. Not to mention pcr testing has a 30% false negative rate meaning you’d need multiple consecutive negative tests to truly be negative (assuming your isolating during that time). 

Basically cases are going up everywhere and as heartbreaking as it is to not see family during the holidays the responsible thing to do is not travel."
None,Then the risk is lower.

Pornfest,"I appreciated your Ted talk and agreement. Yeah, I’ve had some very dark times in my past, am a DSP student and going through some pretty rough shit right now (almost broke up with my SO because I felt like they deserved better, haven’t even talked to them about these thoughts because I know it will stress them out). 

Mental health problems are no joke, and should be treated with tender care and real help. *However* mental health is no excuse for abuse or being shitty to others. I’m really glad that another golden bear saw where I was coming from."
Pornfest,"Do you know what a straw man is? It’s a red herring and seems like you caught a big one with “...you want to dictate what I can/can’t do, yet you have the right to force people into solitary confinement...”

I ain’t forcing you to do shit. Nor are you anywhere near what solitary confinement is. Going to go out on a limb here and guess you’ve never been behind bars, much less been in solitary. 

You have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about,  no idea how much your privileged lifestyle is placing your ego in the driver’s seat, and clearly no clue of what I was trying to push against (hint: Weaver wrote a few paragraphs about it at the top of this thread). I hope you have the state of mind to come back and read your comment back to yourself a week from now and just...reflect.

If you need someone to talk to, I’m here to support you as one Cal student to another. We can study, grab a drink over zoom, shoot the shit, or have a deep conversation about the naturalistic fallacy of rights defined through our social norms. As one human to another, I love you, see your pain, and I have zero interest in hurting someone who isn’t well. 

At the same time, I have zero tolerance for those who ignore the safety and well being of others, and put “muh freedumz” over the real consequences of human driven action in a real world."

registeredvoter7,"You do realize that Donald Trump himself contracted coronavirus, showed the usual symptoms (cough, fever, fatigue) and was ultimately treated?

Also, your theory is that every post, news story, and medical study about people all around the world with COVID losing their sense of taste and smell are part of a vast conspiracy against Trump. ok got it"

If they've already got it, there's not much harm in you visiting them, and it might be your only opportunity. Don't wait to see if they get sicker, if having the opportunity to see them in person before something bad happens, would matter to you."
swenty,"This does not concord with public health advice. People with confirmed Covid infections are instructed to isolate and limit contact with family members of all ages. If you catch it from your parents, even if you don't become a serious case you're likely to infect others who may. Don't intentionally spend time with people who are infected, you will make the problem worse."

bentref11,"As far as we know this is is only in rare cases. Similarly, if a vaccine is 95% effective, there will still be 5% of people who could theoretically get infected even if they were vaccinated. but that doesn't mean that the immunity is worthless, because for most people it *does* work as intended."

Idk if this is helpful or not, but your SO is a grownup and if they didn’t think you were good enough would probably leave or tell you. Again, I don’t know if that is helpful to you lol. Thankfully my SO I can tell a lot of my darker feelings and thoughts to and they know when to be worried and when to just be extra gentle and kinder to me, which I really appreciate. 

And yes, mental health problems are no joke and I know the isolation of lockdown is hard for a lot of people. Thankfully our household was already very introverted and likes staying home and away from people so that part hasn’t been toooo terrible for us, but I’m starting to see we are really the minority there! And my mental health problems have definitely made me a much nicer and more understanding person to others, mostly because I feel so terrible most of the time that I know I don’t want others to feel anything remotely like it! (My main issues are bipolar and adhd and accompanying anxiety garbage, so by terrible I don’t always mean depressed and suicidal, it can also include higher energy bipolar problems and delusions and paranoias, yay!) But they all suck and I don’t want other people to feel like this so I try to be more patient with strangers because idk what they’re going thru. But definitely not an excuse to be terrible.

Thanks for appreciating my tedtalk! I was very confused about golden bear at first and then realised that you think I am a fellow student of yours! I’m not :) This post was linked in the Washington state coronavirus sub, so I am only a fellow west coaster:) 

I hope you can feel better soonish and you can PM me if you want to chat or cry ever:) Feeling bummed is no fun :/"

herfailure,"if u sucked at 61c and aren’t the best at projects, then maybe 161 isn’t the best idea-project 2 is gonna be a huge time suck. but consensus around 188 is not only that exams are insane, but that the class itself is shitty and impractical. pick your poison ig, but play to both your educational interests and strengths"
Z3PHYR-,"61c only overlaps with 161 for like the two weeks where you need to know how assembly and the call stack works. Also need to know how to do hex math.
So overall sucking at 61c won’t matter for 161. 

161 is the second lowest workload CS class I’ve ever taken (only last semester’s iteration of 168 was lower). The first and third projects don’t really take too much time. Project 2 is the longest but you get adequate time to do it. I’ll also note that project 1 and project 3 are different from typical cs projects because you’re not really coding anything but rather applying security exploits. 

I never took 188 but from what I hear the project load is about the same or slightly easier than 161. You’ll have to spend more time studying for tests with 188 tho. 

161 is more applicable to general SWE but just take whichever seems more interesting tbh. Easy to get into either of these in a later semester anyway."
Infinite-Breath7418,I personally thought 161 was much easier in terms of tests and projects and I struggled with 61c myself. 161 is a good class imo. I’d recommend taking it
Parking_Quit6982,Take 161
four_o_clock,which concepts from 61c are the most relevant in 161?
four_o_clock,could I ask why you think this way?
groovu,"The how programs are structured in memory, and the C part."
Parking_Quit6982,"1. I have heard from many many people that 188 is useless
2. Only the first two weeks or so depend on the knowledge of 61c. 61c teaches you about computer architecture and 161 does not touch on the hardware stuff. You only need to know how the stack works which is pretty trivial (compared to what else you needed to know for 61c).
3. even if you’re “not the best” proj 2 will definitely help you get better :)
4. some of 161 is FUN 

I don’t think 61c and 161 are that comparable tbh"
