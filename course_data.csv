TheFortunesFool,Chill out and get full amt of sleep
Electronic-Ice-2788,Dream about the exam
PossiblyMaybeNever,Study for no more than 2 hours at a time then take a 10-15min brisk walk outside while observing what’s around you (so you’re not thinking about your exam). This kind of break will help with clearing your head and lowering your stress level. I also listen to my fave tunes while studying. Good luck!

1020yex,Any tips on taking CS61A and CHEM 1A at the same time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/1020yex/any_tips_on_taking_cs61a_and_chem_1a_at_the_same/
unsuspectingdinosaur,"Sorry for the long comment hahahah but here’s what helped me when I took both at the same time. 

I started prepping for cs61a before the semester since all the content is online. I watched lectures and tried out the labs. Don’t look at past exams just yet because it is very discouraging lol. I think going up to the first midterms content was sufficient for me to have a nice little buffer at the beginning of the semester. 

It’s hard to prep for chem because the content isn’t public. But I think brushing up on stoichiometry/unit conversions is good at the beginning.

When the semester starts, prioritize keeping up with the lectures and assignments for both classes. Start assignments and finish them as early as possible! 

doing projects alone in cs61a was hard but it really helped me learn a lot more than when I did projects with a partner. I didn’t have alot of programming experience back then, so it was helpful for me. But it’s up to you. But grinding past exams in 61a is essential for exams imo. I would start studying for exams early so you can do like 1-2 a day for a week or so. Doing 10 past exams for each mt and the final (lmao) helped me, but looking back on it that seemed like too many… 

For chem 1a, I recommend focusing on discussions, understanding them helped me alot. In the year I took it, we didn’t get a lot of past exams, so I would redo discussions first before taking a mock exam because of the limited resources.

for both classes, knowing the topics you don’t understand and focusing on that was really helpful for me while studying. Keeping a log of questions i got wrong and a detailed description of why I got it wrong helped me a lot.

slc is a great outside resource for chem. I think they have study groups for chem 1a. i can’t speak for 1a, but I did the chem 3a study group and it was amazing. There are also a lot of CSM/hkn/staff exam review sessions for 61a that are helpful, as well as CSM sections."
krishdroid,"Start cs61a projects early and make sure you GRIND practice exams. Honestly quality > quantity, but the more you do and understand those tests, the better score you’ll get. Also go to office hours because most the TAs in 61a are so nice and they’re genuinely trying to help you succeed . You got this and ur not gonna kys this sem :)"

assume_pi_is_3,"Don’t overload yourself on courses, you’ll get burned out. I’d aim for two technical CS courses per semester, but you’ll have three occasionally when it’s worth it. Ask people that have taken specific courses about their experiences with different professors. 

As far as studying, don’t do it in a vacuum. Go to office hours and meet people, talk about things, and then help other people when you figure it out. It’s very easy to feel alone, because CS at Cal can be a machine/you are just a number, but don’t let that get to you. Definitely make the effort to make friends, even if it’s just for the semester. 

Keep in mind that the courses are often paced with the part of the class that is above-average. If you feel behind, that’s probably normal. You’re not alone. 

Good luck when you get here."
ProfessorPlum168,"Assuming no AP carryover classes, you have a minimum 8 lower division and 7 upper division classes to fulfill your CS degree.  Assuming that all 15 classes are technical classes, that’s 50% of your classes that you’ll take over the course of your 4 years.  You’ll probably also either have electives that are technical and/or perhaps pick up a second major like Physics or Stats or Data Science that will have its fair share of technicals.  The point is, you’re going to have semesters where you’re going to have to take 3 or even 4 technicals.   It will pretty much be impossible to avoid that.  What you want to do is to plan out mixing technicals that involve a lot of project work, with technicals that are more homework-only based, and make sure you line up your prerequisites correctly, even though the university does not check for prerequisites.  Look at the HKN website for a flowchart of what classes might interest you.

61A, 61B and 61C you want to take separately and not combine.  There are very demanding upper division courses that you should not combine either - 162, 170, 189, 164 come to mind."
NewlimeCharacter,"Thanks for the tips! I’ve heard CS70 in particular is a challenging course, what would you recommend in terms of studying / preparing for it?"
NewlimeCharacter,"Thanks! That makes sense, luckily I have programming experience with a few languages including Python."
WafflePeak,I think this is overall good advice but not it is not really ever worth it to take three technical classes at once. You do not have to do this as a CS major and honestly even two at once is very tough
NewlimeCharacter,"Thanks for your advice!

Would you recommend taking Math 1B, CS61A and EE16A in the 1st semester, or would it be better to push one of them to the next semester?"
NewlimeCharacter,"Thank you so much for your insight! I looked into the HKN website, the flowchart really helps!

Would it make sense to take Math 1B, CS61A, and EE16A in my first semester? Or should I push one of them to second semester? Also I was curious as to whether it’s mandatory to take a breadth course in the 1st semester, or you can do it anytime?"
oski-is-watching,"general study tips are pretty generic, just don't overload yourself that semester in terms of classes/clubs because you will need the time to go to office hours, homework parties, etc to succeed in the class especially if you don't have prior experience. look into the IMT (intro to mathematical thinking) decal; even if you don't take the actual decal there's a lot of really good beginner-friendly material on the site that will help prep you for the discrete math part of the course. 

I've heard people also take stat 134/140 before, because the probability portion goes quite fast and is difficult for people who haven't been exposed to it. this isn't absolutely necessary to do, plenty of people do fine without it too, but if you arrive after taking 61a and 61b and need a high grade in cs70 to meet the gpa cap and declare the major, I'd say that taking a probability course first would be a solid move to be safe. 

I personally found cs70 the most exciting and 61b the most challenging of them all, just because I'm pretty shit at coding large-scale projects :(("
assume_pi_is_3,"Fair point. I realized I included EE classes in my count, which is why I had 3 sometimes. You’re right though, three techs is tough."
assume_pi_is_3,"If I were you, I'd take EE16A in the spring. The EE courses are fewer in number than the CS ones, so you've got more flexibility. I pushed it off and it worked out ok, that's all I can say for sure. 

Your first semester in Berkeley will most likely not be an easy one, for more reasons than just class. Better to take fewer classes than overload yourself and hate it on day 1. Just my two cents."
ProfessorPlum168,"Quite frankly (this might be a minority opinion) if there’s a way you can skip Math 1B at Berkeley, you should.  It’s a big weeder class without that much benefit to you IMO from a CS standpoint. The easiest way to skip the class is of course to get a 5 in AP Calc BC, but you can also “skip” by taking a Calc 2 class in community college and transfer the credits.  Also by doing this, you can take EE16A, though I guess you could take it concurrently with Math 1B. I don’t think there’s really a whole lot of Math 1B in the 16A class, probably more 1A that is needed.

Ideally, you’d want to take CS61A, EE16A, and then your R&C A class or R&C A plus a breadth.  The university encourages you to go slow your first semester and only take 3 classes plus a decal (13 units) but most of the students I know wind up taking 16 units, with that 4th class being some “easy” class.  If you do wind up taking Math 1B, your first semester would be fairly difficult but still manageable, depending on your organizational skills and study habits.

You can take your breadths at any time, but I highly suggest you take no more than 1 a semester, so that you don’t get in the situation of having to take 4 hard technicals in a given semester.  Remember, you only have to take a minimum 6 breadths instead of 7, as CS61C will be your Physical Science breadth."
NewlimeCharacter,"Thank you so much! I’ll definitely look into the decal and the Stat courses! And if you don’t mind me asking, what was your math background from high school?"
NewlimeCharacter,"That makes sense, and do you think it’s better to complete EE16A and EE16B before taking CS70? I read online that they are good preparation for CS70 but wanted to get more insight."
oski-is-watching,"in high school I took ap calc bc and ap stats

I'd recommend taking either a stats course or math 54 or ee16a at least before taking 70; I took it with math 1a/b as my math background, and while I ended up doing fine I felt like at times I had to put a lot more effort in than my peers to reach the same level of understanding because I didn't have enough background to feel confident in my math/logic skills. I think the mathematical maturity thing is kinda overhyped as in my experience they did a pretty good job of teach proof stuff but also any prior math experience will make the class easier for you, so the more the better."
assume_pi_is_3,"I did, but I think you'd be fine if you took 16B and 70 concurrently. Keep in mind it's been a while for me, so I may be a little fuzzy. EE16A is more pure-math heavy than 16B, whereas CS70 is a lot of theory. There's some overlap between CS61B and CS70 iirc."
NewlimeCharacter,"Sounds good, thanks for all your help!"

kwmpo6,tips for finding a study group in cs61a,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/kwmpo6/tips_for_finding_a_study_group_in_cs61a/
deepthinker1916,"To be honest u don’t really need a group for projects. They are all pretty straightforward and aren’t really too work intensive. Patience and putting in effort to u understand what ur doing suffices. 

That being said one area where I think having a group helps is discussing approaches to solving exam problems. 61A exams can be kinda weird fill in the code blank stuff. And practicing exams and discussing thought processes with others is a good way to grow intuition, in addition to ur own individual practice. 

I would suggest finding a group maybe over piazza or on discord, in addition to anyone who may comment on this Reddit post. I’m not a big discord person but I’m sure there is a 61A discord chat which I heard can be very helpful, maybe someone can drop the link for OP. There might be a Facebook messenger chat also so ask around. 

Best of luck. 61A is all about staying in top of the material: don’t ever slack off thinking u can do stuff later. Put in genuine effort, ask questions, collaborate effectively, and practice diligently and you will do very well!"
None,"Knowing other people in the class was a godsend for me, especially when I’d get hardcore stuck on any homeworks. My personal favorite way to meet people is through the “parties” that are built into the class’ office hours website. You can create an open invite to a Zoom call that anybody in the class can see, or join someone else’s. When you meet someone you work well with, exchange contact info! In my experience, people were never NOT willing to exchange info."
rsha256,the 61a channel at [https://discord.gg/eecs](https://discord.gg/eecs) saved me when i took it (i got a 4.0)
None,"Like most things I'd argue that it depends on the individual. I have always found that for my personality I have found more success approaching studying/projects alone with minimal group effort, and that extended to CS61A.

BUT, if you consider yourself more extroverted definitely take advantage of resources that are conducive to your personality. Like others have said Discords, and Piazza will be the most productive methods to find groups. During the First Day of lecture, there will be a live lecture and people will most likely be dropping discord links in the zoom chat so be looking out for that. 

Again, don't feel pressured into pursing a path that others may have found beneficial if it doesn't help you personally.

Good luck in cs 61A, an amazing class."

queen_laLIT,"the biggest thing I would say is make time for doing a good chunk of practice tests. Both subjects rely on tricks, but I promise, there is a method to the madness— you ll just need time to figure it out. 

Other than that, don’t get too flustered by your raw scores especially in 70. you’re not meant to finish these exams— just walk out of every situation saying that you did your best. 

Also, sign up for tutoring/csm/study group/extra help as soon as you think things are going awry— it won’t hurt :) 

good luck! you got this!"
BZRKK24,"Not going to repeat too much of what the other comments have said, but in my opinion 61a and 70 are very different types of courses. 61a is focused less on the material it teaches and more on developing a mindset of thinking, thus the minutiae of the course material is less important and just doing tons of exams problems is better. 70 on the other hand is a survey course into a wide wide variety of topics within discrete math, and you'd be surprised at how much of the exams are just testing a somewhat surface level understanding of the topics covered in the notes. Thus, imo in 70, it's more important that you do every homework and discussion and carefully read every note rather than just doing a bunch of exam problems like in 61a. Either way, if you put in the effort and time you'll most likely get a score you're happy with. Good luck!"
Flux64,"hey, just took 61A this semester! honestly to do well in the course, assuming you understand lecture content and complete hw/lab/projects, you need to build the intuition necessary to solve the complex problems they throw at you.  It's heavily graded on exams so being able to work fast is a must if you want to get high grades on those tests. 

A lot of people would say that having a lot of coding experience going into 61A will help and I'd strongly agree with that just based off of what I've seen; I had been coding for years which developed my intuition before I took the course and because of that, I had already learned 75% of the course before I had started. I was also able to comprehend new things extremely quickly and apply coding concepts to 61A problems immediately. A few of my friends, on the other hand, struggled a lot more in the course only because it was their first time ever coding, which was unsurprising given that 61A is \_very\_ difficult and a hefty amount of content for a brand-new programmer. If that's you, be prepared to grind out a bunch of practice exams because doing as many problems as you can is pretty much the only way to build intuition.

As for 70, I'm taking it next semester and I'm scared shitless because I've never done anything remotely close to discrete math."
url-,"61A - practice  
70 - dont fall behind, read notes do hw, ride the curve"
None,"This is great advice!  I did tons of practice tests before my 61A exams and barely anything on them was a surprise.  The point is, don't just read the test questions and the test answers, OP.  Set yourself up in a spot, time yourself for the right amount of time, and take the test without getting up or looking at answers.  When the time is up, don't look at the answers until the next day so that you have time to process the questions that you didn't get and so that you're in a different state of mind to understand them (and of course try to solve things you didn't get before looking at the answers).

For each 61a exam I went through this process for maybe 6 or 7 past exams, which means starting this process 10-12 days in advance at least.  But this was the majority of my studying, besides creating a study sheet each time with a lot of the key lecture material.  It paid off really big, I think there was only one exam question throughout all of 61a that was a true surprise (I'd seen permutations of all the others in the past exams.  Not exact copies, but questions with the same thought process)."
queen_laLIT,"Just want to say that you aren’t at that much of a disadvantage if you don’t have coding experience— many of my friends and I didn’t know how to code at all or barely knew how to code, so trust yourself and work hard. On the other hand, many people who knew how to code beforehand became overconfident and dodnt perform up to the mark. Definitely don’t go into the course beating yourself up for not knowing things already— we’re all learning! Trust yourself that you can do it! These classes aren’t difficult; they’re tricky. Put in the hard work, and you should be more than fine."

nedmanrules,"I don't think there's any other way to do well other than know the material. So go though your notes and if by just looking at the topic name  you can recall everything important about that topic you should be ok.

The instructor or gsi should've given you a mock exam or possibly an old midterm. I suggest doing that and asking yourself how you can tweak each question to make it harder, or try combining two questions into one if you can.

I would normally say go to HKN or TBP and do every old exam you can find, but since 61A changed from Scheme to Python in Fall 2011, there hasn't been a lot of material in Python up yet.  Good Luck."

x-yle,"For your first semester of college, choosing to take CS70 probably wasn't a great choice. 

I'm not sure how much programming experience you have, but CS61A is a lot of work with or without prior experience. The staff for 61A are really amazing at trying to make sure that every student has the resources they need to succeed, so I highly recommend using the resources they provide. 

CS70 is more of a Math class geared towards CS students, and can be difficult to understand at times. Again, the staff is usually pretty good and will provide a lot of resources to help make sure you understand the material, but it requires a lot of work to do well in the class.

It's not to late to catch back up and get into a solid routine to do well in all of your classes. I would recommend finding a really good study group for each class, and making sure you have friends in your classes that you can talk to. If you can get a strong group and utilize the resources that are given to you, you should do fine."

wakyasuk,"You'll be fine. That's an average load. 

As for tips:

61A shouldn't be too bad if you have some prior cs experience as there are a lot of people in that class without any experience. Just do as many practice tests as possible before midterms & finals.

70 will be difficult.

ESPM50 with Kurt Spreyer is pretty easy. I missed like a quarter of the lectures and still got an A. Just make sure you don't miss the weekly HWs and study a few hours before the midterm & final. I've heard of some people who only went to the discussions and the review session (no lectures at all) before the tests, and still got an A. Of course, don't actually do that."
None,"My tips for studying: study at least one hour for every class every day.  Makes you more efficient and you finish earlier without needing all-nighters.  I usually time myself.  25 minutes of studying with no distractions.  5 minutes of break.  No distractions means no snacks, no phone, no browsing, no bathroom.  

Just put your heart into it.  "
nabanabaz,"It's a below-average class load. I took CS61A, CS61B, CS61C, CS70 my first semester."
iDoneGoofedPerhaps12,"I don't have any programming experience save the visual basic class that I took in high school, and I'm finding it really challenging but I love the class. John DeNero is so awesome and I love the way that he teaches. I've been stuck on the later parts of the Hog project for the better part of today, though, and that has been frustrating. 

Is it crazy to drop CS70? I've been trying to make friends in my classes, but everyone seems to already be in a social circle already and I don't get to spend much time on campus since I'm working/living at my parent's restaurant in Richmond. 

> It's a below-average class load. I took CS61A, CS61B, CS61C, CS70 my first semester.

Is this guy being serious??? Is that what average looks like? "
wakyasuk,"No, he's not serious. Average looks like 61A, Math 1B/54, Breadth/R1A/R1B, Breadth. "
x-yle,"Yeah, that guy is a joke. Two CS classes a semester is hard for a freshman, but becomes easier as you get into the upper divs. Taking two techs and 1/2 breadths is usually considered average for CS/EECS, but 61A and 70 are two work heavy and difficult techs, and very few people that I know take the two of them together. 

When I took 61A, I was living in the dorms. About half of my floor was in 61A, so we all struggled through it together, which made it much easier. I can't really imagine taking these classes without working with others, and it will probably be difficult. I still think you should try to find a group you can work with, even if it's over hangouts/skype. Or seek help from class alumnus or the GSIs as much as needed. There are plenty of other students who are more than willing to help someone who is eager to learn!"
FillsAMuchNeededGap,"I'm pretty sure he's trolling. That's not an average load. There are people who have schedules like that, but it's not that common. And it would be quite rare to take all 4 of those at the same time since they build on each other at least a little."
None,"Dont listen to nabanabaz, looking at his history he's clearly an elitist eecs student who loves to put others down.

I'm also in 61A, also stuck on the latter portion of hog. There is no doubt that your schedule is challenging and that CS61A is difficult. Keep trying your best!!! Think and rethink, ask for help! Good luck :)"
barakmich,"It's not crazy. If it helps, I took CS70 second semester of Sophomore year. It helps to have gotten used to things with the 61 series. Delaying it is totally fine, if you can pull the minimum credits and drop it for later, go for it. Even if you can't you might be able to pull a Mulligan if you talk to your advisor, or switch P/NP, or grab an extra credit or two from a DeCal or PE or similar.

I'm suggesting this mostly because, here's the thing, *you're not playing the hole, you're playing the course*. Your goal is to train up, learn, and graduate; a couple missteps, even now, won't ruin you. Just keep working at college as a concept, and when you're ready, it'll be easier and you'll be happier."
foggysf,"I'm glad you're pointing this out. I can't stress enough how important it is in these large lectures to get together in small groups. I hope OP takes advantage of all the resources available, and meet a few peeps can get along with and work/struggle/learn the material together. "

mohishunder,"I highly recommend checking out Cal Newport's books and videos.

Beyond grades, the happiest and most successful people in life are those who develop solid relationships (friend as well as romantic), not necessarily those with the highest GPAs.

E.g. the CS grads who get the best jobs in AI (or wherever) will be those who have friends working for hot AI companies.

None,"I grinded past exams for midterm 2 and ended up doing worse than I did on midterm 1. For the final I decided that quality > quantity and took the time after doing a past exam to see why I got part of a question wrong, where the fault in my thinking came from, and how I could change next time. I wrote my solutions in a notebook and annotated them with red pen explaining where the gap in knowledge for me was then I’d immediately hop on an interactive code session and play around with the concept until I felt ready to attack another exam. The learning happens when you’re reviewing your mistakes, not when you’re making them. Good luck!"
TimePipe,"It really depends on why exactly you had a hard time with 61A. If you had difficulty with the course content and felt like you had major gaps in your understanding then I would agree that perhaps going to office hours more and seeking more outside tutoring could be helpful. In general, it is pretty important to understand things roughly as they are presented in the class so you don't fall behind. Thus reviewing the material as you learn it, trying out practice problems, and then taking your questions/concerns to office hours should keep you on top of the material. 

On the other hand, if it was mostly the style of tests that caused you difficulty then essentially you would want to figure out a more effective test prep strategy. Going over past exams is a major component of this but you want to make sure that you go over them in a productive way. Try to take practice exams like the real test, and don't look at answers right away. Then when you are done, go back over slowly and understand every part of the solution. Make sure you can answer to yourself ""How can I come up with this by myself."" To be most effective it would be helpful to spread out your test prep over a week so the ideas can settle in your head. I would say the good news is that the 61A style of tests are not really seen outside of 61A. The classes you take after 61A have exams that reward a deep understanding of the content much more than figuring out small tricks. Of course in those classes the concepts themselves are much harder than 61A but I think those classes lend themselves to a more traditional studying method."

S_jojo_H,Hey! This is not relevant to your Qs but just wanted to say hi as a Korean Male who would get enlisted tomorrow lol :)
the_kedart,"1. Google/YouTube. CS70 topics are all easily google-able and you might find some videos that offer a perspective that is more easy for you to understand. CS70 is purely a math class, nothing strictly CS-related and pure Math topics have boatloads of resources out there.  
2. Textbooks are a bit harder because CS70 doesn't follow any particular textbook. The topics you need would be scattered throughout several different textbooks. With that being said, the second half of the class is pretty much purely a probability crash-course so any good probability text book should cover everything. The first half is such a disjointed mish-mash that you are outta luck there. Course notes are probably your best bet."
